# gmodCSSDownloader

A small program that uses SteamCMD to install CS:Source assets for Garry's Mod easily, quickly and legally (note that I am not a lawyer).

## Platform Support

Currently, this program only works on Windows. We plan to add Linux/Mac support soon.

## Downloading

Head to the releases tab to the side to download a pre-built binary.

## Building from source

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/obfuscatedgenerated/gmodCSSDownloader.git`
2. (optional, but recommended) Create and activate a venv: `python -m venv env` `./env/scripts/activate`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Build: `./build.sh` (on Windows, you'll need Git Bash or an equivalent for the time being)
